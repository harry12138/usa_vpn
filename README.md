=======

Configuration for openvpn to route traffic selectively over the VPN

This is intended to get Access to US based Content like netflix, hulu, grooveshark or Pandora for the rest of the world

What you need:
*  A small VPS located in the USA (I highly recommend the tiny VPS from Edis.at)
*  Openvpn
*  This Server and Client Configuration
